# Lifecycle

Lifecycle provides a basic mechanism to cleanly start up and shut down the application, freeing resources in order before exiting.
It also provides a Signal based shutdown hook, to shutdown on signals like TERM or INT.
Lifecycle is non-framework specific, designed to be integrated with any server framework or application.
